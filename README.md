# RENAL-FAILURE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHILE-LEARNING
Machine learning models predict renal failure by analyzing patient data such as medical history, lab results, and demographics to identify patterns linked to kidney dysfunction. These models help in early detection, enabling timely intervention, personalized treatment, and better patient outcomes for high-risk individuals.

1. Project Overview:

Renal failure, or kidney failure, is a serious health condition that can lead to life-threatening complications if not detected early. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for early diagnosis of renal failure using patient health data.

2. Dataset The dataset used for this project contains medical records, including patient demographics, clinical tests, and lifestyle information. It includes features such as:

      a.    Age, gender, weight, and height

      b.  Blood pressure, glucose levels, creatinine levels

      c. Past history of diseases such as diabetes or hypertension

3. Project Workflow:
   
    a. Data Collection: Acquire and clean the dataset.
   
    b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the data.
   
    c. Feature Engineering: Select and create relevant features for the model.
   
    d. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize features, and split data into training and testing sets.
   
    e. Model Building: Implement and train machine learning models.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.

    a. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search to optimize model performance.

    b. Deployment: Deploy the trained model for practical use (optional).

5. Models Used:
  Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated for this task, including:

    a. Logistic Regression

    b. Random Forest

    c. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

    d. XGBoost

    e. Neural Networks
